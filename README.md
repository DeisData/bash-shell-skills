# Bash Shell Skills

Bash a well-established and reliable command line interface.  While we may be happy with our operating system's point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI), we get a great deal of power by harnessing a few short bash commands.  We can combine tools into powerful pipelines to handle large volumes of files and data.  Bash is essential to interfacing with hardware, the high power computing cluster (HPCC), and remote machines.  Bash commands and grammar will help in other coding languages like Python.
